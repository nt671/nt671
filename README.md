<h1>👋 Hi! I'm Nolan! Thanks for stopping by! </h1>

<h2>🤓 Tech-Geek | Cybersecurity Enthusiast | Database & Systems Administrator </h2>

<p>I'm an IT professional in love with practically all things tech (especially cybersecurity) and have worked in roles as a Database Administrator and Systems Administrator recently. I have a passion for learning and love to research, analyze, and find the best approach to solving problems. Having graduated recently with a BS in InfoSec and Cybersecurity, I've improved my skill set in securing IT infrastructures, mitigating vulnerabilities, and ensuring compliance with security standards. With over 12 years in IT combined with my education in both IT and cybersecurity, I'm driven to create solutions that strengthen security and ultimately improve an organization's overall operational efficiency.</p>
